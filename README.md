# Teardown Bird Mod

---

**Birds!** A new animal joins the scenery.

This mod introduces **19 unique birds** that will roam your world, totaling **38 wings**! Although it's still in its early stages, reaching this point has been the most challenging part of the journey.

### Features:
- **Bird Behavior:** Birds can roam your world, peck the ground, and most importantly, **fly**.
- **Custom Pathfinder:** At the heart of this mod is a custom pathfinder that enables birds to fly without crashing (mostly).
- **Navigation Data:** When playing on a new map, the mod will build navigation data, which may take about 30 seconds. Subsequent plays on the same map will load faster.

### Contest Submission:
This mod was submitted for the **38 Mod Contest** and won **second place**!
